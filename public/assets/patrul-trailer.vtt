00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:05.177
Who are the police?

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:10.004
Some call them lazy layabouts.

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:14.156
Some claim they break the law themselves.

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:19.446
Others claim they're always high and play cards

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.823
Here's our reply:

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:27.198
Yes, that's how we are, so what?

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.964
I'm the major!

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.372
Sergent Berik, open up!

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:41.879
- I'll help you.
- No, don't-

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:42.830
Fire!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.353
Theft, is a short-lived joy.

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:49.122
It's not a bomb.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.170
Noooo!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.743
(Patrol)

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:53.702
Come in with a jump.

00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:56.036
Mikhail, I've bet big on this horse.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.265
130 Tenge (Kazakh currency), come on.
