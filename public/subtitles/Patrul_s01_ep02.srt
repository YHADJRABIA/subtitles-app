2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Usually, our working day starts

3
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,292
with talking to criminals,

4
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:16,334
hobos,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,959
and all kinds of unpleasant people.

6
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,000
But today,

7
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,209
we'll be talking to children.

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,959
It is so nice.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,167
Kids are the most honest

10
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,250
and sincere people in the world.

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,875
Look, it's the coppers!

12
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,209
Balan, watch your vocabulary.

13
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,250
Hello kids.

14
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:47,875
Be seated, kids.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,917
Hello.

16
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,084
Kids, today we'll be welcoming

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,250
uncle Serik and uncle Berik.

18
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,042
They are policemen.

19
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,834
Today, they'll be telling us about their line of work

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,209
Well, what's there to tell?

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,792
Our job is...

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,917
Come on, Berik, tell them.

23
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:08,042
- Why me?
- Go on, you got this.

24
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:09,917
For starters,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,375
policemen uphold the law

26
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,084
we are law enforcers.

27
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,667
Let me tell you.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,500
That's basically it.

29
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,000
Terrorists released the hostages.

30
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,709
And with one bullet,

31
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,000
he killed three terrorists.

32
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,375
That movie's sold on DVD.

33
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:44,875
It's called "Wanted".

34
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,625
Buy it yourselves, watch it home.

35
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,834
Yes, so is our hard job.

36
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,292
Like in the movie, but three times harder.

37
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:56,584
You're working so hard for such a pittance salary?

38
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,375
Well, turns out so.

39
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,750
Our jobs aren't so different actually.

40
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,042
There you have it, kids.

41
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,750
Any questions, kids?

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,625
Go on, kid.

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,084
What about bribery and corruption?

44
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,500
Did they prepare the questions or what?

45
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,250
Who told you that?

46
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,417
- My father.
- What does he do?

47
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,000
He's a prosecutor.

48
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,709
Well, he must be right then.

49
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,584
But it's other bad policemen.

50
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,250
Not us,
we're the good guys.

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,792
One more question?

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,125
You, kid.

53
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,084
Is it true, you beat people?

54
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,834
Who told you that?

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,875
My dad.

56
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,417
- What does he do?
- He's in the secret services.

57
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,709
Secret services you say.

58
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,250
Well, if he says so,
it's probably true.

59
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,584
But it's probably bad policemen.

60
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:45,084
Not us, we are the good guys.

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,959
We're not like that.

62
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,625
Another question? You, girl.

63
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,042
Do policemen really break the law?

64
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,084
Such a smart girl.

65
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,875
Your father's a lawyer, right?

66
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,459
No, my father is a plumber.

67
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,584
Hey, ask your dad "Kops (Liverpool) or Messi?".

68
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,042
You stupid? She's just a kid.

69
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,334
Further questions? You, boy.

70
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,167
Why do you always eat at Qaganat?
(Kazakh food chain)

71
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,709
Are you their guardians?

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,709
That does it with the questions.

73
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:15,709
I also think so.

74
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,250
Time to go, right?

75
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,917
Well, kids, after our story,

76
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,167
does anyone want to become

77
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,667
a policeman?

78
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,500
- Oh kid!
- There's one at least.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,542
May I go to the bathroom?

80
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,292
Chief, let me go!

81
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,292
Hey pig, I have an appointment!

82
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:52,917
Hey watch your tongue

83
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,834
or I'll break your teeth.

84
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,250
Come and say it to my face.

85
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,959
Not man enough, huh?

86
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,334
I break a trainload of people like you.

87
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,667
A trainload you say?

88
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,917
Here we are, then.
End of the line.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,709
Serik, if you had a son

90
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,792
would you make him a policeman?

91
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,459
Of course not.

92
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,667
Why? Let him sleep like a normal person,

93
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,000
and enjoy a regular life with family.

94
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,625
Why did you join the police if so?

95
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,209
I do not know.

96
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,125
My father always dreamed

97
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,000
that I became a policeman.

98
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,042
What about you?

99
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,667
My uncle knows all of them, cops.

100
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,250
Did he serve too?

101
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,750
No, he got arrested by them.

102
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,459
What a moron.

103
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:59,292
It's because of people like you
that we are hated.

104
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,792
These foreign workers are hard to catch

105
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,750
This one'll go to a cell himself

106
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,792
Hey, where are you going?

107
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,625
Have any papers?

108
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:23,292
(In Tajik)
(Talking about an embassy and papers)

109
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:24,417
What's he saying?

110
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,500
Who is he?

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,709
Seems to be speaking Tajik.

112
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,542
Sounds like it.

113
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,250
Do you have money?

114
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,209
(In Tajik)

115
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,125
Hey,  have "money"?

116
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,625
(In Tajik)
Yes, me. (Kha, mane)

117
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,000
What's he saying? I don't understand.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,834
Let's take him.

119
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,709
Let's go, to the hotel.

120
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,834
"Beach hotel", 8-9 stars.

121
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,542
- Hey Mura.
- Hey.

122
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,334
Wow!

123
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,167
What's with your eye?

124
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,000
Did Janishka arrive?

125
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,125
Yes, she did.

126
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,500
Funny isn't it?

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,875
We called the capital,
we warned the secret services.

128
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,500
We'll find your cat.

129
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,084
Don’t forget that my cat

130
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:04,625
is pregnant.

131
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,709
Oh she's also pregnant?

132
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,709
Then we'll call international detectives
and alert interpol.

133
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,250
Okay, we’ll find your cat.

134
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,709
Thank you.

135
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,667
No problem.

136
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,542
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

137
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,042
I've had it with these grandmas.

138
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,417
Hey, take it easy.

139
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,584
Hello.

140
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:22,959
Hello.

141
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,750
Mura, process this one.

142
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,417
Will do.

143
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,209
Who's this?

144
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,417
Some Tajik apparently.

145
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,375
Or God knows who.

146
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,709
Let him stay here for now.

147
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,084
Then send him to immigration police.

148
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,500
Why should he sit and do nothing?

149
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,000
Let him paint the corridor.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,250
Really?

151
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,875
Sure, no worries.

152
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,459
Just restrain him.

153
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,334
Don't worry.

154
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,834
Let's go.

155
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,167
What's up? Anything for us?

156
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,667
Yes, here you go.

157
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,542
Basically, there's a photo with

158
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,000
some Tajik ambassador on it.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,334
He disappeared yesterday night

160
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,000
after going to a store.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Maybe he was robbed.

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,834
There's nothing on him.

163
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:01,959
No money nor papers.

164
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,125
He only speaks Tajik.

165
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,834
Maybe that's our guy?

166
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,000
Maybe he is.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,875
Don't joke about guys.
It's a serious matter.

168
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,042
It comes from our boss.

169
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,167
He'll have to serve.

170
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,125
Yes? If the boss says so.

171
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,375
Alright then.

172
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,792
Shouldn't you get a divorce for that?

173
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,500
This can't come to this.

174
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,875
No, it's not her, it's okay.

175
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,334
- Oh yes?
- Yes, everything's okay.

176
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,084
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,667
Hey, stitch-guy.

178
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,167
Why are you quiet?

179
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,584
To be fair, if I got beaten.

180
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,959
I'd also keep quiet.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,250
You're asking for it, scumbag.

182
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,417
Listen.

183
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:03,750
I always wanted to ask.

184
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:04,750
Who do you want first?

185
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,250
A boy or a girl?

186
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,792
Well, first money,

187
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,959
a car, then get on my feet.

188
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,334
Only then kids.

189
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:16,334
Oh? So said my brother.

190
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,584
See? Your brother gets it.

191
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,875
No, you don't understand.

192
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,917
My brother's already 50.

193
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,000
And he has none of that.

194
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,375
People are different, brother.

195
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,375
Oh I don’t know.

196
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,250
Alright, let's go.

197
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,959
We have to find that ambassador.

198
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,459
Start with the store.

199
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,417
- How much, mate?
- 200 Tenge.

200
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,917
200 Tenge.

201
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,750
Showed him the ambassador’s photo?

202
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,250
I did.

203
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,084
Damn, I forgot the chewing gum.

204
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,125
Be quick.

205
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,375
Oh mate, look carefully.

206
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,834
Have you seen him?

207
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,417
No, I haven't.

208
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,375
Alright, mate.
Thank you (In Kazakh)

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,875
Let's reflect.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,125
What do you mean?

211
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,500
What's there to think about?

212
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,750
I'll do the thinking,
don’t worry.

213
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,334
Suppose, I am a foreigner.

214
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,542
I only speak Tajik.

215
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,334
I walk around town.

216
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,500
And don't know what to do.

217
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,167
What would I do?

218
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,292
I'd seek the Tajiks.

219
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,125
Where do we have many of them?

220
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,875
In Tajikistan, obviously.

221
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,334
Are you usually this stupid?

222
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,167
Actually, you always are.

223
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,792
I'm talking about here.

224
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,292
In tire shops and on construction sites.

225
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,875
That's it then.
Let's start by looking there.

226
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,709
We'll be the immigration police for now.

227
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,375
- Right?
- Right.

228
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,417
Let’s do a population census.

229
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,709
Oh by the way, there are also a lot in doners.

230
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,959
Seriously? It's Turks in doners.

231
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,500
How do you distinguish them?

232
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,834
I just studied.

233
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,667
I didn't become a policeman through relatives.

234
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,334
I graduated.

235
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,834
Also, I have a better education.

236
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,459
Guys, I'm being honest.

237
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,144
There're no Tajiks here.

238
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,785
Only locals work here.

239
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,977
Trust me.

240
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:29,959
Hey, locals don't work for so cheaply.

241
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,417
Honestly, they do.

242
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,125
Mikhail, cement got delivered.

243
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,542
Your signature is needed.

244
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,875
Alexander, I'm busy right now.

245
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,709
You've one just like ours, right?

246
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,273
- Seems so.
- Can I see?

247
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,294
Sure.

248
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,655
So if I say something

249
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,250
everyone will hear me, right?

250
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,792
Everyone will hear, yes.

251
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,250
Alex, send all the Tajiks down.

252
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,696
We have no Tajiks.

253
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,250
Mikhail, you said it like a cop.

254
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,667
Enough joking around.

255
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,503
Send the Tajiks down here.

256
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,042
I am joking, I’ll send them.

257
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,292
I can’t do it now.

258
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,459
Work will stop otherwise.

259
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,542
Wow, seems someone's in trouble.

260
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,625
You guys, I didn’t know,

261
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,292
believe me.

262
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,142
Of course, how could you have known?

263
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,964
Let’s go.

264
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,375
Guys, we need your help.

265
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,867
- Know him?
- No, we don't.

266
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:22,542
Maybe you saw him somewhere?

267
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,042
- No, we didn't.
- Look carefully.

268
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,709
How about you?

269
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,038
From which company?

270
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,973
What's that? He's from the embassy.

271
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,340
I don't know that organisation.

272
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,627
Organisation...

273
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,375
What will we do with them?

274
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,459
Deport them, that's all.

275
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,486
Right, what else?

276
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,250
No other option, right?

277
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,233
Wait, let's come to an agreement.

278
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,459
Remember the address?

279
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,042
No, I remember everything clearly.

280
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,000
Garden Boulevard 3, Apartment 13.

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,834
I'll send you 3 tile workers.

282
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:55,542
Tomorrow morning.

283
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,717
I'm keeping an eye on you.

284
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,875
Berik, is it settled?
Let's go.

285
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
By the way, do you need a tile worker?

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,996
I need an ambassador, mate.

287
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,252
Time's running away.

288
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,875
Let's go, seriously.

289
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,628
Chief, take your baton back.

290
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,710
Or maybe you're scared?

291
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,459
It's not my baton.

292
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,834
Not anymore.

293
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,459
Hey chief, heard this parable?

294
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,459
In ancient Sparta, puny and ugly kids

295
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,667
were thrown down from a hill.

296
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,167
Looks like someone survived

297
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,209
and made it to the duty desk.

298
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,435
What are you hinting at?

299
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,300
I’m not hinting,
I’m telling it to your face

300
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,334
that you’re a sucker.

301
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,042
Hey, cut the trash talk.

302
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,667
Come and make me.

303
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,209
This is it.

304
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,667
Say your prayers, you bastard.

305
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,875
Buddy, have you seen this man?

306
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,750
No chief, I don't know him.

307
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,500
Call the other hobo.

308
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,888
Zhaqsleq (Goodness in Kazakh), come here.

309
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,792
You have such positive names.

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,459
Zhaqsleq, Quanys (Joy), Satleq...

311
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:29,459
Zhaqsleq, have you seen this man?

312
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,476
I haven't.

313
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,584
Don't look at me, but here.

314
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,084
Haven't seen him.

315
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,970
Your eyes say that you've been boozing.

316
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,042
Where's this guy?

317
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:43,732
Quane, will you fight him?

318
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,709
Right now, chief?

319
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,167
What do you think?

320
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,084
I have an appointment.

321
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,152
Appointment?
Just admit you're scared.

322
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,537
No, chief

323
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,571
I'm always ready when you ask.

324
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,167
You always lose.

325
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,834
This bag's hindering me, that's why.

326
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,250
Don't use the bag as an excuse,
you're scared.

327
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,500
Anyway, if you see him.

328
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,375
Call me, alright?

329
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,328
Oh right, you don't have any phones.

330
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:10,032
Chief, leave me your number

331
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:12,334
I'll call from my friend Nadezhda's phone.

332
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,643
Scram already.
Oh wait.

333
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:15,954
Here's my card.

334
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,093
Call me, alright?

335
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,959
If you see him.

336
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,480
Have you settled it?

337
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,875
They're of no use.

338
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,636
Oh yes?

339
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,919
Let's eat at the Uzbek's restaurant?

340
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,070
Yes, hungry policemen are less effective.

341
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:40,983
Have any money by the way?

342
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:44,125
What money? You suggested this.

343
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,247
So why did we come?
Let's go

344
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,709
- Let's do as usual then?
- As usual?

345
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,875
As we always do.

346
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,151
Think.

347
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,585
Salam alajkum.

348
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,125
Akbar, how are you?

349
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,042
- Fine, you.
- Great.

350
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,977
Akbar, I heard you hired new cooks

351
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,792
right?
- That's right.

352
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:04,863
What to they cook?

353
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:08,901
Eastern food, laghman noodles, manti dumplings, plov rice.

354
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,209
Show me the cook's passport.

355
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,959
Here it is.

356
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,529
He's registered with an authorisation.

357
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:17,834
Everything's by the book?

358
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,292
Yes, by the book.

359
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,375
- Where were you born?
- In Italy.

360
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,091
- In the Ural mountains or something?
- No.

361
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,250
Alright, here.

362
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,209
Well done.

363
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,750
Bring me a kebab then.

364
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:30,455
Just a kebab?

365
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,340
Want one too?

366
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,959
Just one for me.

367
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,625
Fine.

368
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:37,283
Oh wait.

369
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:38,834
Have you seen this guy?

370
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,416
- No.
- Did he come to relax or have tea?

371
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,195
I am afraid I haven't seen him.

372
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,962
- You sure? Look again.
- I am sure.

373
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,116
- Green tea also.
- Alright.

374
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:57,019
Hey, punchbag.

375
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,002
Do you even practice sports?

376
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,542
Shut your mouth!

377
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,230
Salam Mura,

378
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,335
What's with your face?

379
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:09,917
Is it Janeshka?

380
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes, sure Janeshka did it.

381
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,625
Don't take it badly mate.

382
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,084
Watch Tarzan.

383
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,084
I'll be back.

384
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,696
What?!
Won't it bite?

385
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:19,757
No, it doesn't bite the police.

386
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,209
So you don’t bite the police, huh?

387
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:38,209
Brace yourself, you punk.

388
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,459
Tarzan, attack!

389
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,729
Hey Mura,

390
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,516
What happened to the dog?

391
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,625
It ran out to the street

392
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,125
and got hit by a car.

393
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,095
Damn it, Mura.

394
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:59,019
I can't even trust you with this?

395
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,744
Doesn't seem to be so serious.

396
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,622
Hey beastmaster, how's it going?

397
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,167
Chief, how's Tarzan doing?

398
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,667
Shut your mouth.

399
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:14,038
You won't leave me in peace.

400
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,156
Face the wall.

401
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:18,794
Mura, what's up?

402
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:19,440
Alright.

403
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,374
Good lord, what happened?

404
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,000
It's all fine, just a cold.

405
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,959
How can I help you?
I'm in a hurry

406
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,375
Is there a free solitary cell?

407
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,875
Yes, there.

408
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,500
Please, take him in.

409
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I have to go.

410
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,375
Just  be careful with him.

411
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,334
He broke five jawbones.

412
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,000
Why're you buckling up?

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,667
Look, traffic police.

414
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,584
- Are you stupid?
- Oh, it wasn't them.

415
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,106
What's all this fuss about?

416
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,209
You know this number?

417
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,000
Three seven, all five.

418
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,084
I don’t know it.

419
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:02,315
Some cool guy is calling.

420
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:04,493
Maybe it's the boss.

421
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:05,886
Yes, hello?

422
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:06,575
Hello,

423
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,593
- This is Quanys.
- What Quanys?

424
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,084
Quanys of Astana (Capital)?

425
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:11,584
No, of course.

426
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,209
You asked me to call when

427
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,542
I saw your ambassador.

428
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,882
Oh,  it's you hobo?

429
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,123
You should have said
you're the drunkard hobo.

430
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,917
I'm not a hobo.

431
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,410
Whatever hobo,
what's up?

432
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,414
Found the ambassador?

433
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:25,328
Just calling to tell you,

434
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,474
this is my number, write it down.

435
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:28,252
Alright then.

436
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,917
The hobo is ringing.

437
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,167
How do they get phones?

438
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,625
This fuss again.

439
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,571
Three sevens, all nines.

440
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,127
Know the number?

441
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,163
I don’t know

442
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:45,209
maybe some other bum.

443
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,792
Yes, maybe that plastic bag guy.

444
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,292
What's going on this time?

445
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,292
Hello.

446
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:54,250
Chief, this is my second number.

447
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,042
Hey alcoholic, hobo.

448
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,393
Don’t call here anymore, got it?

449
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,209
Punk.

450
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:01,709
That hobo again.

451
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,209
Where do they get these numbers?

452
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,709
Another thing to investigate.

453
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,500
Is it true?

454
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,417
You broke 5 jawbones?

455
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,053
No, that's nonsense.

456
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,129
I broke 7.

457
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,628
Want me to get you released?

458
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,292
I have no money.

459
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,792
No need for money.

460
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,000
Just take care of some hobo.

461
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,294
No, I don’t beat hobos or kids.

462
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,125
I see.

463
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,000
Alright, where is he?

464
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,209
It's not just any hobo.

465
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,372
Be careful with him.

466
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:53,084
He has a killer left jab.

467
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:55,951
Wait.

468
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,500
Full contact.

469
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,598
- You're free to go.
- Oh damn!

470
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:11,926
That'll teach you not to show off again.

471
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,334
- Scumbag.
- Screw you.

472
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,193
Hey Mura, send the Tajik out, alright?

473
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,839
I'll drive him away, yes.

474
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,049
Make him bring a bucket of water and a rag.

475
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,486
Understood?
Good.

476
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:43,584
Listen up.

477
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:46,438
Wash the entire car, from here to here.
Ok?

478
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,750
Then that's it, "go home".

479
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:50,940
(In Tajik)
What do you mean "go home"?

480
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,397
(In Tajik)
I need to get to my embassy.

481
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:56,000
Why? No need to wash the interior.

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,542
Just the outside.

483
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,750
Wash everywhere.

484
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,584
Understood?

485
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:02,459
Oh so you understand Tajik now?

486
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:03,875
A very easy language, it turns out.

487
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,792
Go on.

488
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,869
Come on now.

489
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,159
Let's see it.

490
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,625
Rub hard, ok?

491
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,584
Get all the oil and grime off.

492
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:12,584
We changed the oil yesterday.

493
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,414
There isn't much.

494
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,884
Come on, hurry up.

495
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,625
(In Tajik)
I want to smoke. (?)

496
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,133
Done washing?
Did a good job?

497
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,375
Looks quite alright.

498
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,859
Alright, go wash your face.

499
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,918
Then go at the duty desk to be dismissed.

500
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:38,818
Go wash up.

501
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:39,986
(In Tajik)

502
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,875
Face, wash your face.

503
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,584
Then come back.

504
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,084
Go on.

505
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,985
Serik, where do we look
for our ambassador now?

506
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,569
I don't know.

507
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,792
We'll find him.

508
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,834
Is your face clean, now?

509
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,805
We'll get to the bottom of it.

510
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,375
Let's drive.

511
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,027
(Lost foreigner)

512
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,709
(In Tajik)

513
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,750
What a decent Tajik.

514
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,334
Not Tajik but Jacket.

515
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:27,834
Good lord.

516
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:28,911
Here.

517
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,375
Ayran. (Salted yoghurt)

518
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,875
Something to eat.

519
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,584
Give him the whole plastic bag.

520
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:36,987
So, go straight

521
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,584
then right. The embassy is there.

522
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,292
(In Tajik)

523
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,709
I said straight ahead then right.

524
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,125
There's Tajikistan's embassy.

525
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,917
Go. Move along.

526
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,417
Let's go.

527
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,584
That's how the next day ended.

528
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,709
In our line of work

529
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,047
today is never the same as yesterday.

530
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,214
Today is never like tomorrow.

531
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,542
But we always hope that tomorrow

532
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,167
will be better than today.
