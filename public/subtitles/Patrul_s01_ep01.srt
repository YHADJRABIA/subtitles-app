00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,482
There are many kinds of professions in the world.

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,740
Some are prestigious, others less so.

4
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:22,591
Well, I have the most prestigious one in the world.

5
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,707
And people, relate to us differently.

6
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,921
The biggest law offenders, are the police themselves.

7
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,452
All they care about is finding flaws,
they're all idiots.

8
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:33,826
What's there to say about them?

9
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,102
When these cops are here, it's a bloody mess.

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,402
What are they good for?

11
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:39,444
I don't even know who I should fear most

12
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:42,034
criminals, or the cops themselves.

13
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:47,782
We are regular people, not villains.

14
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:50,290
It's just that our line of work is different from everyone's.

15
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:52,514
As soon as something happens to people,

16
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,655
we're the first ones they come running to.

17
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:57,489
Praised be our honourable policemen.

18
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,101
If it weren't for you...

19
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:01,915
Dear policemen, what would be without you.

20
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,015
They're my saviours.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,156
If it weren't for them, I could have been killed.

22
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,277
Real men.

23
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:12,417
(In Kazakh)

24
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,313
What would we do without you.

25
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:17,577
Here you have it,

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,718
our work isn't always valued.

27
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,288
Some understand us, others don't.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,714
Regardless of all the hurdles,

29
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,455
I love my work.

30
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,139
I am proud to be a policeman.

Patrol

37
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:42,661
Since my childhood,

38
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,843
I've dreamt of becoming a policeman.

39
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:49,126
Being part of valiant upholders of the law is very difficult.

40
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,879
I worked diligently, to fulfill my dream.

41
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:56,339
To become a policeman,
I had to graduate with honours.

42
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:59,690
4 years of legal education.

43
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,259
2 more years of higher police academy.

44
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,846
Only then, did I finally get to wear
these long-awaited epaulettes.

45
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:14,830
As it turns out, for some people,

46
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:16,902
there is a shortcut to that journey.

47
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:25,560
(In Kazakh)

48
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,410
Berik, come in. (Kazakh)

49
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:35,440
Salam alajkum.

50
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,182
Congratulations. (Kazakh)

51
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,296
Just like that,

52
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:42,663
a bad apple spoils the whole barrel.

53
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,912
I just got pulled over illegally by the police.

54
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,702
We'll find out why.

55
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,981
Just because some illiterate people

56
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:52,656
accidentally end up in law enforcement agencies,

57
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,570
us, the police are hated.

58
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,859
Your papers.

59
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,018
On what basis?

60
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:59,123
and why aren't you introducing yourself?

61
00:02:59,177 --> 00:02:59,955
Huh?

62
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:02,254
Why aren't you doing this by the book?

63
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,084
Answer, you are being recorded.

64
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,990
What's going on, mate?

65
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,870
Give me the camera,
it's mine, mate.

66
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,810
And this is our chief.

67
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:26,413
Head of the Chapaev district police department.

68
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:27,698
The police major.

69
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,128
Usually, those in such a position,

70
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:32,650
own an expensive jeep,

71
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,699
a large cottage, and only eat in restaurants.

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,572
But our boss is not like that.

73
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,522
He is honest and modest.

74
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,333
Drives an ordinary car,

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,608
lives in an ordinary flat.

76
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:45,710
And doesn't eat in restaurants.

77
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,808
The most expensive thing he owns is an iPhone

78
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,486
which was gifted to him.

79
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,848
Yes.

80
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,767
Hello.

81
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,398
So, how is the sound quality?

82
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:58,855
Great, right?

83
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,617
Well, what do you mean?

84
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,115
It's an iPhone after all.

85
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:05,802
- Yes?
- Chief, may I?

86
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:06,885
Come in.

87
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,182
Alright, I'll call you back later.

88
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:13,803
- Salam alajkum
- Wa alajkum salam

89
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,502
I'm Murat, Sarsenbaj's son.

90
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,443
(Kazakh)

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,780
I know your father well.

92
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,271
Back in the days,

93
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,500
the whole town was praying for us.

94
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,847
Why?

95
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,261
We were the best motor mechanics.

96
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:36,168
No one but us could disassemble a tractor's motor.

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,450
I just read your resume right now, it's funny.

98
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:47,744
So you are the drawing champion of the Kokmorsk ditrict?

99
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,889
I am.

100
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,495
Graduated second best.
(Mispronouncing in Kazakh instead of Russian)

101

(Correcting prononciation)

102
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,683
Your astrological sign is cancer.

103
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,153
Chinese year of the ox.

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,100
Very useful information.

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,300
That's exactly why we need guys like you.

106
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,740
Who filled out the resume?

107
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,560
I did.

108
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,804
- I bet you did.
- I gave it my best.

109
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,420
Who do you want to be?

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,828
Well, I want to be in secret service.

111
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,366
Or make it somewhere up in the ministry.

112
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:22,489
For now, you'll be on duty desk,

113
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:23,628
then we'll see how you manage.

114
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:24,904
- Ok?
- Ok.

115
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,776
"Yes sir" should be your answer.

116
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,593
Forget about being a civilian.

117
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:31,744
You're a duty officer now

118
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,049
of the Chapaev district, no less.

119
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:38,059
Whoever walks into our precinct will see you first.

120
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:39,653
- Understood?
- Understood.

121
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:42,593
Get that rubbish off your eye.

122
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,549
You're the face of our precinct now.

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,726
That's it, dismissed.

124
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,914
By the way, do you know where the bluetooth is?

125
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,675
No bluetooth.
I only have municipal phones

126
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,981
Fine, dismissed.

127
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:12,649
Such freedom when walkie-talkies are quiet.
If only it were forever.

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,723
They'll be quiet all day.

129
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:17,168
Oh yeah?
Did you read that in the horoscope?

130
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,314
No, why?

131
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,186
I just turned off the volume.

132
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,835
What do you mean?
You turned off our walkie-talkie?!

133
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,259
Well yes,

134
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,838
this way, we aren't bothered.

135
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:32,552
Are you stupid?
I've never seen someone do that.

136
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:34,055
You idiot.

137
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,861
#3 what the hell's going on?! Do you copy?

138
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:38,634
Over.

139
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,049
#3 copy.

140
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,541
Robbery in your area, proceed urgently.

141
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,181
Why aren't you answering?

142
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:47,456
Copy, we are on our way.

143
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:50,041
We just have a bad network here.

144
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,755
Your penatly will be as bad as your network.

145
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,659
Alright, we are on our way.

146
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:58,042
You moron, let's go.

147
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,621
What about the food?

148
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,927
Bring it with you.

149
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,084
It's better if I bring it in me.

150
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,911
Suit yourself, just do it quickly.

151
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:07,901
Come on already.

152
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:13,952
I used to imagine the life of a policeman as in Holywood movies.

153
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:20,840
Reality is otherwise.

154
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:26,071
Hey, go sleep elsewhere.

155
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,986
But today, we have a more serious assignement.

156
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,051
By the way, my name is Serik.

157
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,434
I'm a regular patrolman.

158
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,282
I've been patrolling every corner of this district
 for 9 years.

159
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,780
As you guessed,
this goblin is my new partner, Berik.

160
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:45,989
Why goblin?
Because you're still a greenhorn.

161
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,302
Well, well, well...

162
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,623
Slow down, we have some offender.

163
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:54,099
(In Kazakh)

164
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,049
He got scared away.

165
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,634
You're still a little bit of a moron.

166
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,754
Who are you constantly talking to?

167
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,727
Talking to myself.
 As if I could talk to someone else.

168
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:05,465
Your boxing madness
has knocked the brains out of you.

169
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,516
You shouldn't have take up boxing.

170
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,648
You should have taken up boxing.

171
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,145
To make you use your brain.

172
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,150
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,228
A lot of boxers and wrestlers mess up in life.

174
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,412
Wrestlers are always stronger.

175
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,017
Where did you see that?

176
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,638
Just look at the UFC.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,814
There, boxers don't stand a chance at all.
Wrestlers dominate.

178
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,892
Just don't watch the women's UFC

179
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,249
and you'll be fine, got it?

180
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:30,994
This isn't women's UFC.

181
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,996
Shut up now, we have arrived.

182
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,101
You have something, does it hurt?

183
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,195
At last.
What took you so long?

184
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,076
We've been waiting for 2 hours.

185
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,030
What happened, miss?

186
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,137
He was robbed.

187
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,374
And while you were coming,

188
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,558
he was robbed again.

189
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:00,317
Hey lady, cut the jokes and the <i>orgasms</i>.
Alright?

190
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:01,025
Sarcasm*

191
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,262
Oh right, sarcasm.

192
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,478
Don't you worry.

193
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,011
I don't get it

194
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,749
I was walking, then 2 guys jumped me.

195
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,493
What a disaster.

196
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:10,803
As they attacked you,

197
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,495
and robbed you, did they say anything?

198
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:13,401
Well, of course...

199
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,412
they greeted him and apologised.

200
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,136
They robbed him then called you.

201
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,987
Move along, miss.
Who are you?

202
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:19,979
I'm a mother.

203
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:20,807
What? His mother?

204
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,431
No, I have two kids.

205
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,556
I don't want this happening to them.

206
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,924
Everything will be alright with your kids.

207
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,615
Your kids will always be healthy and all.

208
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,832
Move along now.
Please, don't bother us.

209
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,368
We have it under control.

210
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:35,296
Remember how they looked?

211
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,076
Basically, one had a red-gray jacket

212
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,285
with a blue sweater

213
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,055
and a cap with "Abidas" written on it.

214
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,004
- Wow.
- Such accuracy, mate.

215
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,740
How can you remember such details?

216
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,318
Well, these were my own clothes.

217
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:50,497
Alright, let's go.

218
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,579
We'll figure it out, driving around.

219
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:56,025
Wait, where are you taking him?!

220
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:57,497
We'll take him where needed.

221
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:58,721
Come on miss.

222
00:09:58,827 --> 00:09:59,951
To the police station,
where else?

223
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,225
I bet you'll leave him on the road somewhere

224
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,953
as if nothing happened.

225
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,163
Are you crazy?

226
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:07,653
We're taking him to the station.

227
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:08,734
before looking for the criminals.

228
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,756
- Where is your station?
- On Shevchenko.

229
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,843
Oh wait, perhaps you could give me a ride then.

230
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,913
Lady, it's not our way.
We need to work.

231
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:19,334
Ok, fine.
Then I'll report you arrived 2 hours late.

232
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:21,189
Alright, fine.

233
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:24,503
- Thanks, you guys are the best.
- Come on.

234
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,481
This is Mura's first day.

235
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:39,852
He probably figured he'd be locking up bandits

236
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,987
racketeers, or drug mules.

237
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,425
But for now,

238
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,042
it's only drunkards.

239
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:51,028
(In Kazakh)

240
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,215
Hello Mura. (Kazakh)

241
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:53,237
Open up.

242
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,865
Let him sober up then release him.

243
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,205
- Ok?
- Ok.

244
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,294
Who's this?
A criminal, right?

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,879
Are you serious?

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:18,224
(In Kazakh)

247
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,650
Sober up, then we'll release you.
Ok?

248
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,372
Where are we even going?

249
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,915
Patroling around.

250
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:32,854
If we don't find them,
we'll fill in your report.

251
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,027
Guys,

252
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,999
do you think he's that stupid?

253
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,510
To wear my stuff,
in this neighbourhood even?

254
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,863
Of course, he's stupid

255
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,860
He'd be at university otherwise.

256
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,207
Or at least, would have found a job.

257
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,623
Instead of doing all this nonsense.

258
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,594
That's "elemantary", mate.

259
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,455
We say "elementary".

260
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,569
It's better if I go home.

261
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,789
That's all right, just forget it.

262
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:57,230
Hey, that's not "advocuate".

263
00:11:57,547 --> 00:12:00,144
How would we find the suspect without you?

264
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,945
Adequate*

265
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:05,890
(Radio) #1, do you copy?

266
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,495
Will we actually get him?

267
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,135
Don't worry, matey.

268
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,554
We've eaten sheep.
(Expression: I know what I'm doing)

269
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,457
We've eaten dog*
(Correcting expression)

270
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,349
No, it's the Koreans who eat dog.

271
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,224
We eat sheep.
That's the truth.

272
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,613
Well, well...

273
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,615
(In Kazakh)

274
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,998
Do this again,
and I'll bash your head in.

275
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:29,281
- I'm just joking.
- Whatever.

276
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,030
Come on.
(In Kazakh)

277
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,958
What?

278
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:38,897
- I said come on, we've arrived.
- Oh, I see.

279
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:55,074
This stinks.

280
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,448
Hey!

281
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:57,949
Oh, salam alajkum, man.

282
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,123
What's up?

283
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:00,666
Have you gone rotten or what?

284
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,850
It's really bad.

285
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,710
How?
Something smells?

286
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:04,749
You don't say!

287
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,195
It's a bloody stench.

288
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,059
I probably ate something wrong then.

289
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,131
You ate a hobo you mean.

290
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,930
Something's bloody decaying in here.

291
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,804
Get out of here at least.

292
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:17,146
Basically, we have a description

293
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:18,306
of someone with a red jacket.

294
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,016
I can't stand this stench.
You carry on.

295
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:22,505
If you see someone with a red jacket,

296
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:23,811
no need to arrest him.

297
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,816
Just bring him here,
and let him die.

298
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:26,841
What a stench!

299
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,837
Hey guys, are you coming for lunch?

300
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,011
No.

301
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,172
I don't get what smells.

302
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,408
Everything's fine.

303
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,319
Hey, chief.

304
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,638
Let me out, I'm sober.

305
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,345
Keep it down.

306
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:52,104
My colleague will come and release you.

307
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,962
(In Kazakh)

308
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,013
It's not my call.

309
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,106
Mura, here you go.

310
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,548
Hold still.
Face the wall.

311
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:08,245
Step back.

312
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,452
Let's go.

313
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,006
The cell.

314
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:15,899
- Almas?
- Mura ?

315
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:16,839
Move it.

316
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:18,488
Your hands.

317
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,759
You alright, Almas?

318
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,524
As you can see, I am not.

319
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,958
What happened?

320
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,144
I was framed.

321
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,124
You were framed?

322
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,985
Sure, it's not your fault.

323
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,170
Someone beat up a woman

324
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,013
took her phone

325
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,677
and purely by chance gave it to you.

326
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,125
(In Kazakh)

327
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,996
- See you.
- Bye.

328
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:52,051
Angela, do you have a minute?

329
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,309
What?

330
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,598
Don't act innoncent.

331
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,348
You can't loiter.

332
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,064
Come here.

333
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,393
I know that already.

334
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,307
I have to make a living somehow.

335
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,956
You are very attractive.

336
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:04,717
And what do you do?
Sell Pirogi, like an idiot?

337
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:06,905
Prostitution would earn you much more.

338
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,076
Screw you.

339
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,438
Angela.

340
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,890
Forgive him,
he's joking.

341
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,074
Angela,

342
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,340
Did you have a customer in a red jacket by chance?

343
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,598
I won't tell you anyway.

344
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:20,391
Hey...

345
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,844
don't make me find cocaine on you.

346
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,249
I'm asking you nicely.

347
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,702
Alright, chief.

348
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,723
There was a guy in a red jacket.

349
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,021
He headed north.

350
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,290
That way?

351
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,474
North is that way.

352
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,758
Are you stupid?

353
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,470
Hey, watch it.
I know where it is.

354
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,299
(In Kazakh)

355
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,256
Alright, thank you Angela.

356
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:40,328
Bye, Snow White.

357
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,996
I'll cut that finger off.

358
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,066
Come on, Mura.

359
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:57,653
We've been former classmates
 for a long time

360
00:15:57,677 --> 00:15:58,689
You could let me go?

361
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,736
I can't, mate.
Really.

362
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,944
Talk to your boss, then?

363
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,852
I can't, it's my first day at work.

364
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,252
Understood.

365
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:11,121
Could you expect we would meet again after so long?

366
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,118
I didn't expect this either.

367
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:19,342
Remember how we used to like the same girl?

368
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,068
I do remember.

369
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:21,934
Inara?

370
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,070
I liked her very much too

371
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,581
but I let you have her.

372
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,452
You're like a brother to me.

373
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:30,085
Sorry brother, I can't just release you.

374
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:32,579
No need, brother.
I way just reminiscing.

375
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,543
Remember when you broke the school window?

376
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,975
I had taken the fall for you.

377
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,391
I remember.

378
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,156
I was almost expelled because of it.

379
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,223
Fine, I'll go.

380
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:51,723
Talk to your boss?

381
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,281
No, going to the toilets.

382
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:02,167
Ajgul?

383
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:13,372
I don't care!
Brothers, relatives, classmates.

384
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:14,979
It's all the same to me.

385
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,108
Everyone is equal before the law.

386
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:26,596
While patrolling

387
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,474
looking for robbers

388
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,556
one might run into peculiar people.

389
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,412
Hey junkie, what you doing here?

390
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,008
Why junkie?

391
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,690
You have no right to talk to me this way.

392
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,586
Talk to me by the book please.

393
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:42,421
Hey buddy,

394
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:44,503
I'll bring you in if you continue.

395
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,068
Why are you naked?

396
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,092
Where in the penal code is it written

397
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:50,740
that walking naked in the street is forbidden?

398
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,051
Alright, man.

399
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:54,947
Forgive us, mister. Sorry

400
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:57,241
The law (in Kazakh)

401
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,482
So long, smart guy.

402
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,480
What gives you the right to say "so long"?!

403
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,641
You're on duty!

404
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,691
Address me by the book.

405
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:20,095
Oh, hello, north south east west.

406
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,006
Basically, there was a robbery.

407
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,899
The suspect was in a red jacket

408
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:26,933
Did you see anything?

409
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,372
No, we saw nothing.

410
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:30,391
Are you even working?

411
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,736
Of course we are.

412
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,140
Every dog knows us here.

413
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:34,725
Dog?

414
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,797
When will people know you?

415
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,317
They're not guiding at all.

416
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,812
Let's ask these punks
if they saw anything.

417
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,628
I don't understand, are they getting high?

418
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,296
Obviously, they don't wash their bottles.

419
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,987
They're crazy.

420
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,268
How's the relaxation going, guys?

421
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,524
At least wash the bottles, right?

422
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:27,934
Junkies don't run that way.

423
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,286
Yes, definitely.

424
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:32,224
How do they do it?

425
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:42,975
Yes, Mura.
I figured you couldn't help

426
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,186
Brother,

427
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,579
in this situation I can't help you at all.

428
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,712
Do you remember

429
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:53,066
when the highschool bully
wanted to steal your money?

430
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:55,147
Well, I helped you.

431
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,352
- When will you bring it?
- We warned you.

432
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:02,794
- Where is the money?
- We were clear about it.

433
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,019
Hey, leave Mura alone.

434
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,033
What did you say?

435
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,719
- Leave him
- Come here!

436
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:19,375
I always took the fall for your blunders.
I kept silent.

437
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,894
Murat, why did you tear up the magazine?

438
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,192
Miss, I did it.

439
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,056
Murat,

440
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:28,192
why did you blow a firecracker in the toilets?

441
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:29,888
Sir, I did it.

442
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,639
- Almas, was it you?
- Yes.

443
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,788
Murat, why are you cussing at girls?

444
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,924
Miss, it was me cussing.

445
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:40,531
Almas,

446
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,780
did you trample all the flowers by the school?

447
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,695
Yes Murat?

448
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:46,841
Yes, he did it.

449
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:52,869
It's over, we won't find him.

450
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:54,823
Hey, have some patience.

451
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,211
There is no rush.

452
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,782
No, we won't find anyone.

453
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,301
Let's record your statement.

454
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,540
How about driving me home?

455
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,429
What's the address?

456
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:07,972
Shevchenko-Kirova.

457
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,128
How much?

458
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,362
500

459
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,858
700?

460
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:15,645
Let's go.

461
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,141
Let's have some fun, right?

462
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:30,773
Sir, my son ended up here.

463
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:33,059
Murat?  Is that you?

464
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:38,326
(In Kazakh)

465
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,120
Almas is here, can you help him?

466
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,766
Mom, don't bother asking.

467
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:44,866
He can't help.

468
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:46,094
(In Kazakh)

469
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:47,958
Why are you shouting?

470
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:49,522
What did you?

471
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,415
I just got involved with the wrong people.

472
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,463
So?
You really can't help?

473
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,199
It's no use

474
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,499
He can't help.
He tried.

475
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:03,948
We have always been like a family.

476
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,376
You played together in our house.

477
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,563
You really can't help?

478
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:11,915
(In Kazakh)

479
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,426
Almas, you are free to go.

480
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,306
But it's your first day at work.

481
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,336
It will be alright.
Go

482
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:31,876
Thank you (in Kazakh)

483
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,400
Thank you brother.

484
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,416
You truly won't get in trouble?

485
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,613
No, our boss is a good person.

486
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:40,834
Hey dummy,

487
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,043
what have you done?

488
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,613
Already messing up on your first day.

489
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:49,859
I don't care if it's your friend, classmate or relative.

490
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,633
The law applies to everyone.

491
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,471
Yes?

492
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,235
You're in luck.

493
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,416
The victim withdrew his complaint.

494
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:09,561
Otherwise you'd be out of here.

495
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:10,899
Permission to speak.

496
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:11,984
You may.

497
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,165
Where did you get this souvenir from?

498
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,804
Is it from Dubai, by any chance?

499
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,626
Today was a waste, if I'm frank.

500
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,012
We're just burning fuel away.

501
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:35,266
Yes, that's how it is.

502
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,923
A waste of time.

503
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:41,991
Oh look, isn't that...

504
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,401
It's our suspect, right?

505
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,317
The jacket matching  the description.

506
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,546
Yes, let's go!

507
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,439
I almost broke my shoulders.

508
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:55,891
Well, wasn't I right?

509
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:57,952
Boxing is better than wrestling.

510
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:58,942
Here we go again.

511
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:01,911
If I didn't grab him, he'd have run away.

512
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,532
Mate, it's my punch that made him motionless.

513
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:05,291
Don't start.

514
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,674
(Radio)
To all units,

515
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:10,080
the red jacket suspect
has been apprehended.

516
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,112
Over and out.

517
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,829
I'll be damned.

518
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,645
Who did I wrestled?

519
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,074
#3 copy.

520
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:17,728
Damn, let's go apologise.

521
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:18,668
Yes, let's.

522
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,416
This is so embarrassing.

523
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,190
Hey, come here.

524
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,474
What more do you want?

525
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:30,631
I already gave you everything.

526
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,334
Just have your jacket back.

527
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,237
Don't lie you bastards.

528
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:34,788
You want my shoes now, don't you?

529
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:36,234
What do we need them for?

530
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,010
- Come here!
- Screw you!

531
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,966
Boxing, wrestling.

532
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,172
It's athletics we should be doing.

533
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:07,059
Hey, boxing is always the best.
Got it?

534
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,060
It's just that I haven't trained in a while.

535
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,476
(In Kazakh)

536
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:27,883
It's like this every day.

537
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:29,980
I just got home from work.

538
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,185
Yet, it's already time to head back.

539
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:33,975
I don't know if there is a heaven

540
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:36,108
and if policemen end up there.

541
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,349
I'd like to believe there is.

542
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:42,127
I don't know either if there's a place for me there.

543
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,917
What I am sure about though

544
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:47,315
is that I'll oversleep all I want there.
