Fully internationalised fullstack Next.js application (React/Node.js) with MongoDB & DatoCMS:

- authentication system using JWT (register, login, password recovery, email verification...etc) partly coupled to next-auth and using nodemailer to send verification tokens;
- authentication-protected dashboard section;
- public section to browse series and download subtitles;
- entirely translated api responses and paths;
- form validation with zod;
- api spam-protection middleware system using upstash & redis;
- entirely responsive UX-UI.
